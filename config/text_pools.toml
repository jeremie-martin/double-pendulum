# Text Pools for Video Captions
#
# Philosophy:
# - Each caption should be self-contained and make sense on its own
# - The visual chaos IS the payoff - captions just set the stage
# - Use {count} for formatted pendulum count (e.g., "1M", "500K")
# - Keep it clean, modern, not cheesy

# =============================================================================
# HOOKS - Opening captions (first few seconds)
# Goal: Set context, grab attention, let the visual do the rest
# =============================================================================
