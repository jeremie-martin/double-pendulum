# Text Pools for Video Captions
#
# Philosophy:
# - Each caption should be self-contained and make sense on its own
# - The visual chaos IS the payoff - captions just set the stage
# - Use {count} for formatted pendulum count (e.g., "1M", "500K")

# =============================================================================
# HOOKS - Opening captions (first few seconds)
# Goal: Set context, grab attention, let the visual do the rest
# =============================================================================

[hooks.science]
# Factual statements about the simulation - each works standalone
texts = [
    "Same starting position.",
    "{count} pendulums.",
    "Nearly identical conditions.",
    "Tiny differences in starting angle.",
    "The butterfly effect.",
    "Chaos theory in action.",
]

[hooks.wait]
# Classic anticipation hooks - simple and effective
texts = [
    "Wait for it...",
    "Keep watching...",
    "Don't blink.",
    "Watch until the end.",
]

[hooks.challenge]
# Interactive - asks viewer to engage
texts = [
    "Can you see it coming?",
    "Find the exact moment.",
    "Watch for the divergence.",
]

[hooks.pov]
# POV-style immersive hooks - visual is the punchline
texts = [
    "POV: chaos theory",
    "POV: the butterfly effect",
    "POV: sensitive dependence",
    "POV: deterministic chaos",
]

[hooks.satisfying]
# Oddly satisfying vibes
texts = [
    "This is oddly satisfying.",
    "I could watch this forever.",
    "Why is this so calming?",
    "Hypnotic.",
]

[hooks.relatable]
# Meme-style relatable - chaos is the punchline
texts = [
    "My last brain cell at 3am:",
    "My thoughts during a meeting:",
    "Me trying to make a decision:",
    "My plans vs reality:",
    "Monday morning energy:",
]

[hooks.count]
# Simple count display - just the facts
texts = [
    "{count} pendulums",
    "{count} double pendulums",
    "{count} simulated pendulums",
]

# =============================================================================
# ENGAGEMENT - End captions for calls to action
# Goal: Encourage likes, subscribes, or tease next video
# =============================================================================

[engagement.subscribe]
# Call to action - subscribe/follow
texts = [
    "Subscribe for more chaos",
    "Follow for more physics",
    "More simulations coming...",
]

[engagement.tease]
# Tease next video or bigger runs
texts = [
    "Next one will blow your mind",
    "Want to see 1 million?",
    "This was just the beginning...",
    "Wait until you see the next one",
    "The sequel is even better",
]

[engagement.question]
# Engage with questions
texts = [
    "Did you catch the moment?",
    "Which pendulum survived longest?",
    "How many times did you rewatch?",
]
