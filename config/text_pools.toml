# Text Pools for Video Captions
#
# Philosophy:
# - Each caption should be self-contained and make sense on its own
# - The visual chaos IS the payoff - captions just set the stage
# - Use {count} for formatted pendulum count (e.g., "1M", "500K")
# - Keep it clean, modern, not cheesy

# =============================================================================
# HOOKS - Opening captions (first few seconds)
# Goal: Set context, grab attention, let the visual do the rest
# =============================================================================

[hooks.science]
# Factual statements about the simulation - each works standalone

# Classic anticipation hooks - simple and effective
texts = [
    "Wait for it...",

    "Stay focused.",

[hooks.challenge]
# Interactive - asks viewer to engage
texts = [
    "Spot when it happens.",
    "Find the moment.",
    "Watch for the shift.",

# POV-style immersive hooks - visual is the punchline
texts = [

[hooks.satisfying]
# Oddly satisfying vibes
texts = [
    "Oddly satisfying.",
    "Pure satisfaction.",
    "So smooth.",
    "Hypnotic.",

# NOTE: Removed "relatable" meme hooks - they don't fit the elegant physics aesthetic

[hooks.count]
# Simple count display - just the facts
texts = [

    "{count} simulations",

[hooks.mystery]
# Mysterious, intriguing hooks
texts = [

    "Then this happens.",
    "Watch what unfolds.",

# COUNTDOWN - Numbers for countdown template
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# ENGAGEMENT - End captions for calls to action
# Goal: Encourage likes, subscribes, or tease next video
# =============================================================================
