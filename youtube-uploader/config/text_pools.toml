# Text Pools for Video Captions
#
# Each pool contains multiple text variations that can be randomly selected.
# Use {count} for formatted pendulum count (e.g., "1M", "500K")
# Use {boom_time} for boom timestamp (e.g., "8.4s")
#
# Organized by category:
# - hooks: First 0-2 seconds, grab attention
# - build: Between hook and boom, create tension
# - payoff: At/after boom, the climax

# =============================================================================
# HOOKS - First 0-2 seconds
# Goal: Grab attention, make viewer want to keep watching
